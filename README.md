# CovidJS

This is an NPM package designed to make it easier to integrate data from various COVID-related API's into your project so you can easily access up-to-date vaccine availability data.

The purpose of this library is to make it easier for developers to access multiple COVID-related API's and allow the maintainers of those API's to have some control over client implementations. This provides the API developers with the ability to help move projects over to a new versions of their API should they need to make a breaking change. This also helps developers more easily access data from multiple API's and update their implementations just by updating a dependency.
